			<trans-unit id="templavoila" approved="yes" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>TemplaVoila seems to be dead. Alexander Schnitzler and Wouter Woulter have updated TemplaVoila for 6.2. But in case of the new Backend API of TYPO3 it seems to be very hard to update TemplaVoila for TYPO3 7 and higher. Please use something else like Fluid Content Elements which has much more acceptance and more performance.</source>
